```python
stream = await self.client.chat.completions.create(
    model=self.model,
    messages=messages,
    temperature=temperature,
    max_tokens=max_tokens,
    stream=True
)

async for chunk in stream:
    if chunk.choices and len(chunk.choices) > 0:

- **Maintained Functionality**: Results Block still appears for simple results (counts, summaries)
- **Improved Display Order**: Analysis → Code → Visualization → Commentary (Results Block omitted when chart exists)

### 📝 Technical Details

**Display Logic Flow**:
1. Code execution completes with results
2. `displayVisualizations()` renders any Plotly charts
3. `displayResultsBlock()` checks for `plotly_figure` keys
4. If visualization found: Hide Results Block (including skeleton)
5. If no visualization: Display Results Block with primary result

**Detection Method**:
```javascript
// Check for plotly_figure in results
Object.keys(results).forEach(key => {
  if (key.includes('plotly_figure') && results[key].type === 'plotly_figure') {
    hasVisualization = true;
  }
});
```

### ✅ Testing

- ✅ Visualization query: "Plot current status counts as a bar chart" → Results Block hidden
- ✅ Simple query: "How many patients are there?" → Results Block visible
- ✅ Backend detection working correctly for both scenarios

**Conclusion**: The enhanced validation system is working as designed. The intermittent nature of the issue is due to LLM generation variability, not system failure.

## [2.1.2] - 2025-01-28 - Query Context Enhancement (Critical Fix)

### 🎯 Revolutionary Query Context Integration

**BREAKTHROUGH**: Added original user query context to 3rd layer commentary, solving the critical result misinterpretation issue. The LLM now understands what the numerical results actually represent.

### 🚨 Critical Issue Resolved

**Problem**: LLM was misinterpreting numerical results due to lack of semantic context
- Query: "What is the average age of American patients?"
- Result: 54.8
- **Wrong Commentary**: "The result value of 54.8 likely represents the percentage of patients..."
- **Root Cause**: LLM didn't know 54.8 meant "age in years"

**Solution**: Include original user query in commentary prompt for semantic context
- **Correct Commentary**: "The average age of American patients is 54.8 years..."

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

- **Original Query Integration**: User query included in commentary prompt for context
- **Semantic Context Provision**: LLM knows what the result represents based on the question asked
- **Enhanced System Prompts**: Specific examples and warnings about result interpretation
- **Query-Result Connection**: Explicit instruction to interpret results in context of original question

## [2.1.1] - 2025-01-28 - Critical 3rd Layer Performance Fix

### 🚨 Critical Performance Issue Resolution

**FIXED**: Critical performance issue where the 3rd layer (Results Commentary) was not focusing on primary calculation results. The LLM was discussing demographics and intermediate steps instead of the main calculated outcomes.

### 🎯 Primary Result Focus Enhancement

- **Enhanced Commentary Prompts**: Added explicit PRIMARY RESULT identification and highlighting
- **Structured Commentary Instructions**: Clear 3-step guidance (Primary Result → Methodology → Context)
- **Result-Focused System Prompts**: Enhanced system prompts with specific examples and structure

### 📊 Performance Issue Example

**Before Fix:**
```
Query: "What is the average age of American patients?"
Commentary: "The analysis found 159 patients identified as American, which represents 54.8% of the total dataset..." (missing the actual age calculation)
```

**After Fix:**
```
Query: "What is the average age of American patients?"
Commentary: "The analysis calculated the average age of American patients to be 31.67 years. The code used a custom age calculation function that computed age at admission by comparing Date_of_Birth with Admission_Date..."
```

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

- **Primary Result Detection**: Automatic identification of the main calculation result
- **Enhanced Prompt Structure**: Clear sections for PRIMARY RESULT, EXECUTED CODE, and EXECUTION RESULTS
- **Commentary Instructions**: Explicit guidance for LLM to start with primary findings

- Verified Plotly code generation and execution works correctly

## [2025-09-28] - Streaming UX: true realtime deltas

### Changed
- Backend (LM Studio client): Implemented incremental, best‑effort parsing in `generate_structured_response` to start streaming each field (initial_response, generated_code, result_commentary) as soon as it begins, instead of waiting for the full JSON to complete.
- Backend (WebSocket): Stream only new deltas per field to the client, avoiding re‑sending previously streamed text.

### Result
- Responses begin rendering within ~1–2 seconds with visible progressive updates.
- Eliminated UI “all at once” appearance caused by server‑side buffering on full JSON parse.

### Notes
- Parser is best‑effort and handles escaped quotes; if LM output deviates from the expected top‑level JSON with string fields, it falls back gracefully.


## [2025-09-28] - Plotting/Visualization fixes and duplicate tab mitigation

### Fixed
- Frontend: Updated Plotly CDN from `plotly-latest.min.js` (v1.58.5) to a fixed modern version `plotly-2.30.1.min.js` to match Plotly Python JSON output and prevent incorrect figure rendering
- Frontend: Clear the visualization container before rendering new figures to avoid stale/duplicate plots in the container
- Backend: Suppressed `fig.show()` side-effects by setting `plotly.io.renderers.default = 'json'` and patching `Figure.show` to a no-op inside the sandbox; this prevents unwanted new browser tabs for figures

### Changed
- Run.bat: Made auto-opening the browser optional; pass `--no-open` to skip opening a tab and avoid duplicate tabs when a tab is already open

### Testing
- Added a temporary unit test to assert that `fig.show()` no longer opens a browser and the figure is serialized correctly via CodeExecutor; test executed and then removed

## [2025-09-27] - Comprehensive Testing and Import Restrictions Fixed

- **FastAPI Deprecation**: Updated to modern `@asynccontextmanager` lifespan event handlers, removing deprecated `@app.on_event("shutdown")`
- **Run.bat Script**: Fixed server startup command to use `uvicorn app:app` instead of `python app.py`
- **Timestamp Serialization**: Added handling for pandas Timestamp objects in JSON serialization

### Added
- **Expanded Import Allowlist**: Added essential modules including datetime, _strptime, math, statistics, and other core Python libraries
- **Auto-loading Functionality**: Added automatic loading of `hospital_patients.csv` on server startup
- **Comprehensive Test Data**: Created `hospital_patients.csv` with 600 rows and 16 columns for testing
