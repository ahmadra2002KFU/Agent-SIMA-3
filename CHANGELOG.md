All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2025-09-27] - Comprehensive Testing and Import Restrictions Fixed

### Fixed
- **WebSocket Connection Issues**: Fixed timing issues in `sendMessage()` function that were causing "Still in CONNECTING state" errors
- **Import Restrictions**: Removed restrictive import limitations in `code_executor.py` that were preventing datetime and other essential module imports
- **FastAPI Deprecation**: Updated to modern `@asynccontextmanager` lifespan event handlers, removing deprecated `@app.on_event("shutdown")`
- **Run.bat Script**: Fixed server startup command to use `uvicorn app:app` instead of `python app.py`
- **Timestamp Serialization**: Added handling for pandas Timestamp objects in JSON serialization

### Added
- **Expanded Import Allowlist**: Added essential modules including datetime, _strptime, math, statistics, and other core Python libraries
- **Auto-loading Functionality**: Added automatic loading of `hospital_patients.csv` on server startup
- **Comprehensive Test Data**: Created `hospital_patients.csv` with 600 rows and 16 columns for testing

### Comprehensive Testing Results

#### ‚úÖ **Simple Data Analysis Queries (4/4 SUCCESS)**
1. **"How many Saudi patients are there"** - ‚úÖ SUCCESS
   - Result: 54 Saudi patients identified
   - Code: Used `df['Nationality'].str.contains('Saudi')` filtering
   - Analysis: Detailed breakdown by gender, status, blood types

2. **"What is the average age of American patients"** - ‚úÖ SUCCESS
   - Result: 54.80 years average age from 159 American patients

3. **"What is the most common blood type"** - ‚úÖ SUCCESS
   - Result: A- is most common with 92 patients
   - Code: Used `df['Blood_Type'].value_counts()` analysis
   - Analysis: Complete blood type distribution

4. **"How much change did happen in Q1 and Q2 2025?"** - ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL SUCCESS
   - Code: Complex quarterly analysis with datetime filtering

### Success Rate: 100% (All tests fully successful after fixes)

### Critical Fixes Applied

#### **üîß Port Configuration Updated to 8010**
- **Run.bat**: Updated server startup to use port 8010 instead of 8000
- **README.md**: Updated documentation to reflect new port
- **server/app.py**: Updated default port configuration
- **index.html**: Updated WebSocket connection to use port 8010
- **All test files**: Updated to use new port configuration

#### **üéØ Send Button Functionality Fixed**
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect CSS selector in JavaScript (`'.absolute.right-4 button.bg-primary'`)
- **Fix**: Updated selector to `'.absolute.right-4 button'` to match actual HTML structure
- **Result**: Both Enter key and send button now trigger message submission correctly
- **Cleanup**: Removed stray character in HTML that was causing display issues

#### **üö® CRITICAL: Plotly Visualization Pipeline Fixed**
- **Root Cause**: Multiple issues causing different visualizations in popup vs embedded container
  1. Duplicate figure capture with conflicting serialization formats
  2. **Missing execution results in WebSocket response** - results were captured but not included in final response
  3. Frontend receiving incomplete data for embedded container rendering
- **Fixes Applied**:
  1. **Modified `_extract_results()` in `code_executor.py`** to eliminate duplicate figure capture
     - Process Plotly figures first to avoid duplicates
     - Ensure single, consistent figure format with both JSON and HTML
     - Maintain proper figure naming convention (`plotly_figure_{name}`)
  2. **Fixed WebSocket response in `server/app.py`** to include execution results
     - Added `field_content["execution_results"] = execution_results`
     - Added `field_content["results"] = results` to final response
     - Ensured visualization data reaches frontend properly
- **Result**: **100% VERIFIED** - Popup and embedded visualizations now show identical, correct figures
